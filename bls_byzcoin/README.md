Christopher Benz - BLS ByzCoin

# Christopher Benz - BLS ByzCoin

We describe and implement Bls-ByzCoinX, which uses the Boneh- Lynn-Shacham signature scheme to improve scalability of the consensus mecha- nism and to make it more reliable. Finally, we evaluate the implementation per- formance by comparing it with existing solutions and show that Bls-ByzCoinX, which provides more robustness than ByzCoin, scales up to 1000 nodes while be- ing at most two times slower than ByzCoin.
