# Pablo Lorenceau - Omniledger

Distributed legder technology is gaining traction in many applications, first
and foremost in decentralized payment systems such as e.g. Bitcoin. This
adaption imposes challenges on the scalability of such systems, both in total
transaction throughput, as well as in the number of participating processing
nodes.

This report describes the implementation of OmniLedger [10], a scalable
blockchain with a flexible user interface. We will first describe the necessary
background in 2 and discuss how OmniLedger improves on the current state of
blockchain technology.
