# Gudmundsson Björn - Calypso on Ethereum

In the modern era of technology, blockchains seems to be the answer to everything. A question that arises early on when developing a blockchain based application is: “Which blockchain platform should be used to solve this problem?”. Currently there are many kinds of different blockchain platforms so choosing a blockchain platform to use is a non-trivial task. The researchers at the Decentralized and Distributed systems (DEDIS) laboratory at École polytechnique federale de Lausanne (EPFL), along with researchers at Trinity College in the United states have developed an application framework called Calypso[1] that allows for auditable sharing of data over blockchains. Calypso uses an in- house developed blockchain called Byzcoin to store on-chain secrets. Byzcoin is capable of running smart contracts to verify the validity of transactions before they are added to a block or validated on the blockchain. The Calypso framework has received great praise from both academics and industry but currently it has been developed using the Byzcoin blockchain. Byzcoin has not received the widespread commercial and industrial adapta- tion that other blockchains such as Ethereum and HyperLedger have received, but the underlying structure of the Calypso framework should be blockchain platform indepen- dent, as long as the platform supports certain operations. This project explores whether the Calypso framework really is platform independent as long the platform supports the deployment and interaction with smart contract on the blockchain.
