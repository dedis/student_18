%%% talk about what we currently have, what the goal is

SkipChains are cryptographically-traversable, offline and peer-to-peer-verifiable blockchain structures. A SkipChain is traversable in both directions, such that one party can efficiently prove the correctness of a transaction anywhere in time with respect to the other party's reference point on the blockchain, in a logarithmic number of steps, regardless of which party has a more up-to-date view of the blockchain \cite{blog}.
Today, we have the public Cothority status dashboard at http://status.dedis.ch/, which gives no detail into what blocks and data are stored on the SkipChain. How do we inspect and verify the data that is stored in a given SkipChain? The goal of this project is to develop a platform allowing users to navigate through a SkipChain's blocks and their content.
