   \chapter{Conclusion}

    This project demonstrates the feasibility of the democratization of DAGA as an anonymous authentication mechanism
    by both \begin{itemize}
        \item allowing  every system able to speak OIDC to make the move (pretty much every system) without pain
        \item and showing that it is possible to offer a user-friendly interface
    \end{itemize}
    This was done without introducing alien ideas into the DAGA library and Cothority making them easier to maintain and reuse for other purposes.
    Nothing prevent us to tie DAGA more closely to the POP framework, everything is already usable, it lacks only the little bit
    of boilerplate extracting the keys from a party transcript.

    Still it is far from being perfect and finished, notably from a "features" point of view, we haven't yet defined ways
    to allow 3rd-party services to evolve the authentication contexts (add / remove users, revoke context, deny authentication if user exhausted some quota of authentication etc.).
    From a security point of view we can list the following things that would need our future attention:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item currently, the authentication messages can be replayed...
        \item we would need ways such as memguard\sidenote{
            https://github.com/awnumar/memguard
        } to protect the storage of secrets and keys in memory.
        \item currently the state of the service contains sensitive information
            (per-round secrets, secret-keys of the daga servers associated with each contexts, etc.)that are persisted into bbolt...
            We propose to make it fully stateless if possible by deriving every needed secret from the master secret key
            of the node and other information and "storing" more state in the clients.
        \item As already said the server-side code of the library would need some reviews too
        \item We noticed that the deniability property as it is currently defined in the paper doesn't totally hold.
            At the end of a successful authentication every servers obtain the list of all the NIZK proofs that state they all did their work correctly.
            Since those proofs are verifiable by anyone and we are in an anytrust setting then for sure someone did authenticate (if not that would mean that
            the honest server did not follow the protocol this could qualify as a dishonest behavior..).
            hence we would need to modify the implementation to periodically add some noise, release proof transcripts that are nothing but simulations etc..
%    this means that we weaken deniability (the NIZK proofs of the servers + anytrust ==> someone authenticated for sure)
%    => in fact even in vanilla daga description if we don't publish the server proofs, at the end of successful auth ALL servers obtain all the proofs and tag
%    => since we are in anytrust mean all but one server can be malicious/dishonnest => deniability doesn't hold as advertised in paper (but still)
    \end{itemize}
%- daga:
%    I took some time investigating if we can keep daga properties (notably deniability) but turn PKClient into a
%    non interactive truly zero knowledge proof or a truly zk proof with a single server.
%    (currently the multiple servers of daga are really only there to satisfy HVZK via anytrust which is here for deniability(and for linkability via the tags..fuck..)
%    and to reduce damages resulting of the compromission of a single server in centralized case,
%    (we cannot tolerate subset of them being down etc..ok we are in a decentralized lab but maybe better to have centralized client server and to have a pool of servers etc..)
%    (NIDA paper, vaudenay construction ONTAP etc..)
%    dropped by lack of time, would be a entire thesis subject and probably very different protocol redo proofs etc..)
%    => since deniability already weakened IMO maybe can think of more efficient ways to guarantee same things but then there are probably already constructs doing the same thing cf vaudenay etc..
%
%    -final goal was not clearly defined
%    at the begining of putting things together was envisioned to use equivalent of pop parties to gather keys as part of the daga/login service
%    (begin - join- end- context generation etc..)

    \chapter{Annex}
    Instructions to run the proof of concept.

    Prerequisites:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item a working Go installation\sidecite{pike_go_nodate}
        \item a working docker and docker-compose installation
        \item retrieve github.com/dedis/student\_18\_daga and install the dagaclient and dagadaemon cli
        \item add the following two aliases to /etc/hosts:\newline
            172.18.0.1 opapp.poc\newline
            172.18.0.1 rpapp.poc\newline
            where 172.18.0.1 should be the IP of your host computer as seen from the future docker containers,
            adapt if it is not the case.
    \end{itemize}

    then:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item cd in the student\_18\_daga/PoC directory
        \item \emph{make}
        \item follow the instructions on screen
    \end{enumerate}

\end{document}
