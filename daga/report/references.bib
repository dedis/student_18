	title = {Deniable {Anonymous} {Group} {Authentication}},
	abstract = {In some situations, users need to authenticate as distinct members of some welldeﬁned group, without revealing their individual identities: to validate and corroborate a leak, for example, or to count participants in a closed anonymous forum. Current group authentication techniques oﬀering this capability, however, may de-anonymize users if an attacker later compromises their private keys. Addressing this under-explored risk, we present deniable anonymous group authentication (DAGA), the ﬁrst anonymous authentication protocol oﬀering proportionality, forward anonymity, and deniability in combination. To oﬀer these properties, DAGA leverages a federation of collectively (but not individually) trusted servers. These servers collectively generate tags during authentication, which ensure client distinctness and proportionality, while cryptographically scrubbing information that could later de-anonymize clients. After an authentication round, clients and (honest) servers securely erase their ephemeral secrets, protecting clients from later de-anonymization even if an attacker eventually compromises all long-term client and server keys. A proof-of-concept prototype validates DAGA’s practicality, authenticating a client into a 32-member group in one second, or into a 2048-member group in two minutes.},

	title = {Scalable {Anonymous} {Group} {Communication} in the {Anytrust} {Model}},
	abstract = {Anonymous communication capabilities are useful and desirable, but practical onion routing approaches are vulnerable to trafﬁc analysis and DoS attacks—especially against a powerful adversary, such as a repressive government or compromised ISP. To ﬁll this gap we introduce D3, the ﬁrst practical anonymous group communication system offering anonymity and disruption resistance against strong trafﬁc analysis and collusion attacks, with scalability to hundreds of group members and quick response to churn. D3 builds on a trust model we call anytrust. Anytrust is a decentralized client/server network model, in which each of many clients—representing group members—trust only that at least one of a smaller but diverse set of “servers” or “super-peers” behaves honestly, but clients need not know which server to trust. By combining and adapting veriﬁable shufﬂe and DC-nets techniques to anytrust, D3 achieves short shufﬂe latencies and efﬁcient tree-based DC-nets ciphertext combining, while guaranteeing message anonymity and integrity, transmission proportionality among group members, and adaptability to both network/node failures and active disruption. Experiments with a working prototype demonstrate that D3 is practical at scales infeasible in prior systems offering comparable security.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the seemingly paradoxical notion of anonymous authentication: authenticating yourself without revealing your identity. Before studying the technical aspects of anonymous Internet connections and anonymous authentication, we begin with a discussion of privacy and why it is important. Although the necessity of privacy is well accepted in the computer security community, the concrete reasons as to why are often not understood. We will demonstrate that such an understanding is crucial for providing technical solutions that solve the real problems at hand. Given this background, we brieﬂy survey the known technologies for constructing anonymous Internet connections. Finally, we study how it is possible to achieve anonymous authentication (on top of anonymous Internet connections). We present deﬁnitions and a number of diﬀerent protocols with diﬀerent properties. In addition to the basic problem, we also show how it is possible (in a certain model) to achieve revocable anonymity, and explain why this is of importance.},

However, both approaches have disadvantages: PoW leads to massive amounts of wasted electricity and re-centralization, whereas major stakeholders in PoS might be able to create a monopoly. In this work, we propose proof-of-personhood (PoP), a mechanism that binds physical entities to virtual identities in a way that enables accountability while preserving anonymity. Afterwards we introduce PoPCoin, a new cryptocurrency, whose consensus mechanism leverages PoP to eliminate the disadvantages of PoW and PoS while ensuring security. PoPCoin leads to a continuously fair and democratic wealth creation process which paves the way for an experimental basic income infrastructure.},

	abstract = {Bias-resistant public randomness is a critical component in many (distributed) protocols. Generating public randomness is hard, however, because active adversaries may behave dishonestly to bias public random choices toward their advantage. Existing solutions do not scale to hundreds or thousands of participants, as is needed in many decentralized systems. We propose two large-scale distributed protocols, RandHound and RandHerd, which provide publicly-veriﬁable, unpredictable, and unbiasable randomness against Byzantine adversaries. RandHound relies on an untrusted client to divide a set of randomness servers into groups for scalability, and it depends on the pigeonhole principle to ensure output integrity, even for non-random, adversarial group choices. RandHerd implements an efﬁcient, decentralized randomness beacon. RandHerd is structurally similar to a BFT protocol, but uses RandHound in a one-time setup to arrange participants into veriﬁably unbiased random secret-sharing groups, which then repeatedly produce random output at predeﬁned intervals. Our prototype demonstrates that RandHound and RandHerd achieve good performance across hundreds of participants while retaining a low failure probability by properly selecting protocol parameters, such as a group size and secret-sharing threshold. For example, when sharding 512 nodes into groups of 32, our experiments show that RandHound can produce fresh random output after 240 seconds. RandHerd, after a setup phase of 260 seconds, is able to generate fresh random output in intervals of approximately 6 seconds. For this conﬁguration, both protocols operate at a failure probability of at most 0.08\% against a Byzantine adversary.},

Applications in electronic commerce and communication can thus use these protocols to provide anonymous authentication while accommodating frequent changes in membership. We build these protocols on top of a new primitive: the veriﬁably common secret encoding. We show a construction for this primitive, the security of which is based on the existence of public-key cryptosystems capable of securely encoding multiple messages containing the same plaintext. Because the size of our construct grows linearly with the number of members in the group, we describe techniques for partitioning groups to improve performance.},

A release provides k-anonymity protection if the information for each person contained in the release cannot be distinguished from at least k-1 individuals whose information also appears in the release. This paper also examines re-identification attacks that can be realized on releases that adhere to kanonymity unless accompanying policies are respected.

Indeed, there are cases where the prover needs to authenticate some data without making it possible for any malicious verifier to transfer the proof to anyone else. It is for instance the case for e-passports where the signature from the national authority authenticates personal data. To solve this problem, we can prove knowledge of a valid signature without revealing it. This proof should be non-transferable. We first study deniability for signature verification. Deniability is essentially a weaker form of non-transferability. It holds as soon as the protocol is finished (it is often called offline non-transferability). We introduce Offline Non-Transferable Authentication Protocol (ONTAP) and we show that it can be built by using a classical signature scheme and a deniable zero-knowledge proof of knowledge. For that reason, we use a generic transform for {\textless}em{\textgreater}Σ{\textless}/em{\textgreater} -protocols. Finally, we give examples to upgrade signature standards based on RSA or ElGamal into an ONTAP. Our examples are well-suited for implementation in e-passports.},

	abstract = {Releasing a classical digital signature faces to privacy issues. Indeed, there are cases where the prover needs to authenticate some data without making it possible for any malicious verifier to transfer the proof to anyone else. It is for instance the case for e-passports where the signature from the national authority authenticates personal data. To solve this problem, we can prove knowledge of a valid signature without revealing it. This proof should be non-transferable.We first study deniability for signature verification. Deniability is essentially a weaker form of non-transferability. It holds as soon as the protocol is finished (it is often called offline non-transferability).We introduce Offline Non-Transferable Authentication Protocol (ONTAP) and we show that it can be built by using a classical signature scheme and a deniable zero-knowledge proof of knowledge. For that reason, we use a generic transform for Σ-protocols.Finally, we give examples to upgrade signature standards based on RSA or ElGamal into an ONTAP. Our examples are well-suited for implementation in e-passports.},

	doi = {10.14722/ndss.2017.23171},
	abstract = {Several recent standards, including NIST SP 80056A and RFC 5114, advocate the use of “DSA” parameters for Difﬁe-Hellman key exchange. While it is possible to use such parameters securely, additional validation checks are necessary to prevent well-known and potentially devastating attacks. In this paper, we observe that many Difﬁe-Hellman implementations do not properly validate key exchange inputs. Combined with other protocol properties and implementation choices, this can radically decrease security. We measure the prevalence of these parameter choices in the wild for HTTPS, POP3S, SMTP with STARTTLS, SSH, IKEv1, and IKEv2, ﬁnding millions of hosts using DSA and other non-“safe” primes for Difﬁe-Hellman key exchange, many of them in combination with potentially vulnerable behaviors. We examine over 20 open-source cryptographic libraries and applications and observe that until January 2016, not a single one validated subgroup orders by default. We found feasible full or partial key recovery vulnerabilities in OpenSSL, the Exim mail server, the Unbound DNS client, and Amazon’s load balancer, as well as susceptibility to weaker attacks in many other applications.},
