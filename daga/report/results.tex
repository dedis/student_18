    The DAGA cothority was simulated both locally and on DETERLab facilities using the simulation tools provided by Onet.\sidecite{dedis_cothority_nodate}
    The local simulations were run on a 64-bit x86 machine running Debian 9\sidenote{
        CPU: 8 * i7-4710HQ @ 2.50GHz
        RAM: 16GiB
    }
    The DETERLab simulations were run with \emph{pc2133} nodes\sidenote{
        CPU: 4 * Xeon-X3210 @ 2.13GHz
        RAM: 4GiB
    } running Ubuntu 14.04 and connected to the same LAN,  where a delay of 100ms was added between each nodes.

    As was done in the previous works\cite{syta_identity_2015,villard_report_pfs_pop.pdf_2017} we varied the number of clients from
    2 to 32768 by power of 2 and repeated the experiment for cothorities of size 2,4,8,16 and 32.

    As a key difference to the simulations performed by~\cite{syta_identity_2015} and~\cite{villard_report_pfs_pop.pdf_2017}
    the simulations that were performed here are featuring real network communications between different (remote) processes.\sidenote{
        even for the local simulations, all conodes are living in their onw process and all communications are going through the network stack

    We can clearly observe the impact of the 100ms delay existing in the DETERLab setting.
    Comparing the results of the local simulation with the one of~\cite{villard_report_pfs_pop.pdf_2017} we can observe
    a small overhead, probably because now we are running a real cothority (overhead of the cothority framework and network communication).
    Hence in all logic when comparing it to the one of~\cite{syta_identity_2015} we notice improvements of the same order
    as the one noticed in~\cite{villard_report_pfs_pop.pdf_2017}.\sidenote{(~10X) for the same reasons, notably moore's law}
    We can see that even when running our simulation in a real world setting (DETERLab) with network delays, we obtain
    authentication times comparable to or only slightly slower than the ones obtained by~\cite{syta_identity_2015}

    \subsection{Traffic}

    Only the total\sidenote{
        the client-server or server-client traffic should not change much in comparison with~\cite{villard_report_pfs_pop.pdf_2017}.
    } Server traffic was plotted.

    Fig.~\ref{fig:servertraffic} % FIXME RHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA F/*%@# latex wrong fig number !!!!!!!!
    %The following figure
    shows the sum of the data sent by each server during the Authentication of a user.

    \begin{figure}

        \vspace*{1cm}
        \caption{Total Server traffic}
        \label{fig:servertraffic}
    \end{figure}

    Finally we share the conclusions that \blockquote{
        all forms of DAGA traffic grow linearly in the number of clients and nearly linearly in the number of servers
    }\cite{syta_identity_2015} hence our results are coherent.

    %TODO ?
    %You can note that there are some holes in the data, that is because we
    % problems : read tcp io timeout, out of memory, ssh keepalive, bug in cothority/onet cache clean/timeout while protocol alive .. ...
    % etc.. etc.. ran short of time and patience


    %the graphs and quick discussion,
    %comment on moore law,
    %say that probably could/should be quicker if X25519 was used (hypothesis, don't make a fool of myself if it is the case)
    %say there are lots of redundant and probably not useful signatures that slowdown everything
    %+ say that coherent with previous implementations
