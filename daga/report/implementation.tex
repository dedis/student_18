    %TODO see if need to add something and crossref
    The following chapter will present the work that was done during the project the design choices and the current state of advancement.
    We begin by describing the goals and current state before detailing the work done on the three main parts of the project individually:
    \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=!,itemsep=-1ex]
        \item the DAGA library (see~\autoref{subsec:library})
        \item the DAGA cothority service (see~\autoref{subsec:cothority})
        \item the login service and the proof of concept (see~\autoref{subsec:loginservice})
    \end{enumerate}

    The first part uses the work from a previous student as a starting basis\sidecite{villard_report_pfs_pop.pdf_2017},
    the second part builds on the previous to integrate DAGA into the cothority framework,
    while the last part makes use of the previous parts and CoreOS's dex project\sidecite{noauthor_announcing_nodate}
    to implement a login service.

    \section{Overview and goals}
    %TODO cross-ref with future/results/background/previous work
    As already mentioned in the introduction\sidenote{\autoref{ch:introduction}}, the final goal of the project is to offer
    \emph{DAGA authentication as a service}\sidenote{or a "login service" as put in the title}.
    We aim at letting current and future system designers leverage easily DAGA's promises in their design and thus
    offering them the opportunity to take more into account the privacy of their end-users whether it is critical for their mission or not.
    As hinted we would like our solution to remain as generic as possible, i.e.\ not tailored and tied to particular uses
    cases and deployment scenarios.
    Naturally we will need to keep the properties\sidenote{see~\autoref{subsec:properties}} of DAGA while doing so and we will
    try to separate as much as possible the different components and building blocks into well defined abstraction levels.\sidenote{
        e.g.\ to build the "login service", everything from the DAGA library to the full cothority service, looks just like
        a "simple" authentication primitive:\newline \(yes;tag|no;0 = daga(request)\)
    } This implies too that we would like to not pollute the created lower level primitives (e.g. DAGA cothority) with the
    requirements of the upper ones (e.g.\ login service) while implementing them, and thus offering them untouched for other
    future usages.

    \section{Current state and contributions}
    As part of the current work the following contributions were made:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item the DAGA library was ported to kyber.V2, the client-side code was rewritten, issues have been identified and some fixed,
                documentation as well as guidelines for the rewriting of the server-side code have been added.
        \item the library was used to implement DAGA in the cothority framework, featuring:\newline
            \begin{itemize}
                \item a new \emph{service} allowing to build cothorities supporting DAGA authentication and the creation of DAGA contexts
                \item three new \emph{protocols} to support the service
                \item a CLI app to interact with it
                \item test coverage edging 80\% for the protocols and service
                \item boilerplate allowing to run simulations locally as well as on DETERLab's testbed facilities
                \item compliance with the tool that generate proto files to allow future interop with other languages
            \end{itemize}
        \item a system allowing 3rd-party services to delegate the authentication of their users (through the well established OpenID connect standard)
            to a running DAGA cothority was implemented.
        \item working, reproducible and customizable proof of concept of the system mentioned above
    \end{itemize}

    \section{Building blocks / Components}
    \label{sec:components}
    As said, the project can be divided into three main and reasonably well separated level of implementation, or components.
    This section will describe them in turn.
