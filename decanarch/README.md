Simone Colombo - Decentralized Web Archiving

# Simone Colombo - Decentralized Web Archiving

We present DecenArch, a decentralized system for privacy-conscious
webpages archiving. Independent servers retrieve the webpage pointed by
a URL submitted by the user and agree a consensus on its content. The
consensus protocol provides privacy for the parties, which reach a correct
result even in presence of up to 􏰀n􏰈 malicious adversaries, where n is the 3
number of nodes in the system. The result of the consensus phase is then cryptographically verified by the servers and only if the entire process has been correctly executed, the webpage and its external resources are archived on a distributed immutable ledger. Anyone can then access the webpage stored on the ledger, thereby achieving censorship resistance.
