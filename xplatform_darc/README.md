# Leo Meynent - Cross Platform Mobile Frontend for Blockchain Data Handling

This reports describes the work that has been done, for one part on the BC Admin tool, and, for the other part, on the cross-platform mobile application PopCoins. Both are interfaces allowing a user to interact with ByzCoin skipchains, features implemented as a part of DEDISâ€™ Cothority framework. The project focused especially on the management of Distributed Access Right Controls (DARC): its main goal was to provide a terminal CLI1 and a user-friendly mobile application to spawn, evolve and delete them.
To better understand the stakes and outcomes of this project, the report will begin with a short introduction on the Cothority framework and the PopCoins app.
