\paragraph{}

This reports describes the work that has been done, for one part on the BC Admin tool, and, for the other part, on the cross-platform mobile application PopCoins. Both are interfaces allowing a user to interact with \textit{ByzCoin} skipchains, features implemented as a part of DEDIS' \textit{Cothority} framework. The project focused especially on the management of Distributed Access Right Controls (DARC): its main goal was to provide a terminal CLI\footnote{Command Line Interface} and a user-friendly mobile application to spawn, evolve and delete them.

To better understand the stakes and outcomes of this project, the report will begin with a short introduction on the \textit{Cothority} framework and the \textit{PopCoins} app.
