# Louis-Maxence Garret - Making an overview of Cross-Platform projects

This project aims to evaluate some of the most famous cross-platform frameworks through various criteria. These are tested by writing for each a simple and similar application with basic but mandatory features. Frame- works can then be compared to each other, on criteria ranging from ease of integration of existing code to the UI library capabilities.
The report discusses the development process for those applications, the is- sues encountered and their severity level, and finishes with the evaluation of the frameworks.
NativeScript is the starting point of those evaluations as the popcoins app1 developed at DEDIS already depends on this cross-platform framework. Re- act Native, Flutter, Go Mobile, Xamarin and Ionic frameworks are then explored. Finally, a summary of the important information is given and a discussion comparing frameworks altogether takes place.
