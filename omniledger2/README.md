Raphael Dunant - Omniledger

# Raphael Dunant - Omniledger

The purpose of this project is to implement and improve blockchains storage and transactions of accounts, and witness validation of those operations. More precisely, this project has two objectives. The first objective is to add a documented transaction batching library to Omniledger [1]. The second objective is to improve ByzcoinX [2], by reducing the running time in the most frequent situations by a large factor. Omniledger will be presented in section 1.1 and ByzcoinX in section 2.2.1.
This project’s main purposes are the following:
• Have clear and reusable code for current and future projects.
• Make ByzcoinX more efficient for encouraging its use.
The next section will present Omniledger, the blockchain for which all of those technologies are implemented and Merkle trees, a data structure that is the basis upon which transactions are done.
